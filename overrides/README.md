# Hard mode config files
Config files for normal and hard modes are found in `\config-overrides\normal` and `\config-overrides\expert` respectively.

To install hard mode, drag the files inside `\config-overrides\expert` into the main `config` folder, as below:

The same for reverting back to normal mode, plus manually deleting `\config\globalgamerules.cfg` to cancel forced peaceful.

Windows users may also use `pack-mode-switcher.bat` found in the root directory. (It was here so it comes with the pack, but curseforge clearly doesn't want suspicious file in the release.')
