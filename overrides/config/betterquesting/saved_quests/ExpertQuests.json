Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§r will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§r. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§r... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.\n\nRecipes will default to showing a §6Iron Tool §rof the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool\u0027s material in the recipes: it can be whatever you\u0027d like.\n\nFor now, make a §aHammer§r (not a §aMining Hammer§r, mind you... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§r. §6Plates§r can make a §aFile§r, Files can make §6Rods§r, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.\n\n§6Wrought Iron§r is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress.\n\nThis quest technically accepts any tool material, but it is highly recommended to use §6Wrought Iron§r.",

It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§r frequently used items so you don\u0027t have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§r all at once.\n\n§3Crafting Stations§r are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r for the convenience they offer.\n\nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r, which you will be able to make later.\n\nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.\n\nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn\u0027t ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.\n\nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.",

The first of which, §6Aluminium§r, is going to be important in the immediate future.\n\nThere is a diagram of how to build the EBF in §bJEI§r. The second and third levels must be a 3x3 square shape of Coil Blocks (§6Cupronickel§r is the only type of coil block you have access to for now) with an empty center. You can also §6sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.\n\nHowever, the bottom and top layers are very flexible. The §6EBF Controller§r must be on the §ebottom layer§r of the structure, and on the §emiddle of an outer edge§r; the §6Muffler Hatch§r must be in the §eexact middle of the top layer§r. Otherwise, you can put the hatches and buses wherever you want, filling in all gaps in each layer with §6Heatproof Machine Casings§r. It\u0027s worth noting that you must §euse at least §29§e Heatproof Machine Casings in your layout or the structure will not form§r.\n\nThis quest calls for a §2maintenance hatch§r, two energy hatches, a fluid input and output, and an item input and output, which is a total of 7 positions. Their specific order and placement don\u0027t matter, as long as you can access them. The 8th position is your EBF controller, leaving 9 gaps to be filled by Heatproof Machine Casings. If you did everything right, the structure will form: the colors on its hatches and casings will unify, and the controller will say \"Idling.\"\n\nYou\u0027ll most likely want to locate your power quite near to the EBF. It is very power hungry, and if it cannot get enough energy, progress on the current item smelting will start to regress. Be careful to ensure the EBF has enough power, and keep a Soft Hammer nearby to pause it by tapping the controller if you run out of power.\n\n§2In GTCEu, all hatches except Maintenance can be shared between Multiblocks!",

Any item pushed into an ME Interface is digitized and placed in your ME Network storage.\n\nWhen adjacent to one or more §aMolecular Assemblers§r, crafting table patterns can be crafted. It will use as many adjacent Molecular Assemblers as possible, restricted by availability and number of §aCo-processors§r in your crafting CPU multiblock.\n\nWhen adjacent to any other block, you can use processing patterns with a machine to insert items into the machine. Processing patterns require that the finished item is inserted back into the ME Network by way of an ME Interface (though it doesn\u0027t need to be the same ME Interface the Pattern is in).\n\nME Interfaces can be wrenched to ensure they only communicate with a particular adjacent block, or can be crafted into a micropart form to fit multiple in the same block space (each micropart only interacting with the adjacent block face).\n\nLocking mode will prevent an §6Interface§r from sending more ingredients until §eone of various conditions§r are met.

The way that it works is that each level of the tower after the first will output an additional fluid from the recipe. §cAny output fluids in excess of available buses are voided§r.\n\nWhat you need the Distillation Tower for initially is to break down §9Oil§r and §9Fermented Biomass§r into useful resources.§9 Oil§r distillation, with its four outputs, will require a §efive-block-high Distillation Tower§r (the quest materials are for such a tower; if you want to build it bigger, you will need §ean additional 7 casings and 1 fluid output per floor§r).\n\nAny recipe with more than four output fluids (like §9Fermented Biomass§r) will need a larger tower. Make sure to increase the height of your tower to accommodate all of the outputs you want to keep. Also check the voltage requirements of the recipes, as many Distillation Tower recipes need higher voltages than MV. §eYou can swap out your Energy Input for a higher tier one when that time comes§r. Also, any recipe that has an item output will need an §6Output Bus§r, anywhere on the bottom layer.\n\nThe tower we\u0027ll be building at first is 3x3x5 (LxWxH), with a hollow center.

The §6Energy Input Hatch§r can go wherever you can fit it on the bottom layer. The rest of the 3x3 must be filled with §6Clean Stainless Steel Casings§r.§2 You also need a Maintenance Hatch, which can go anywhere on the structure.§r Each level above that is a ring of 7 Clean Stainless Steel Casings, one §6Fluid Output§r and nothing in the center, except for the topmost layer which needs an eighth casing to fill in the center, capping off the top.\n\nFor distilling fluids which only have one useful output, like §9Biomass§r, it is recommended to use single-block Distilleries, due to their energy efficiency and generally lower costs.",

This is an important machine you will be using for many things in the future.\n\nYou don\u0027t really need a LV one, as you can use the superior §3Steam Grinder§r. LV or MV ones could be used for automation. However, HV ones provide chanced output, extremely important for §eOre Processing§r and other processes.\n\nOne useful application for a Macerator in the near future is grinding down §6Clay§r or §6Terracotta§r into §6Clay Dust§r.\n\nBesides not having limited durability, a key advantage of Macerators over Mortars is the chance to get additional materials when grinding things down. These are called §ebyproducts§r, and HV or better Macerators have three slots instead of one so byproducts can appear.\n\nWhen reading Macerator recipes in §bJEI§r, you can tell which outputs are byproducts by seeing if §ethe tooltip tells you it has a chance to appear§r: guaranteed outputs do not list a chance. §2The chance increases by a certain amount for each tier of machine you have above the tier of recipe. This chance is also listed in the tooltip.§r\n\n§2Macerators can now also recycle your old Machines for some extra materials.§r\n\nFinally, a Macerator will only start processing if there is room for all possible outputs. Make sure you empty them so they can keep working.",

This one is less flexible than the previous GregTech multiblocks, as you can only put hatches where the preview shows. §6Sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.\n\nThe §bJEI§r preview shows §eall valid hatch locations§r, but you don\u0027t actually need that many fluid hatches. You can replace any of the hatch positions in the structure with §2Fusion Machine Casings§r as long as you have at least §atwo Fluid Input Hatches§r and §aone Fluid Output Hatch§r. It\u0027s possible to use input/output hatches in every valid location, if you prefer.\n\nBecause of this, the quest only asks for §248 Fusion Machine Casings§r. If you want to use the minimum number of fluid hatches, you\u0027ll need to craft an additional §229 Fusion Machine Casings§r. In addition to the §a48 Fusion Machine Casings§r, you will also need §631 Fusion Glass§r or §631 Fusion Machine Casings§r. §bFusion Glass is cheaper, and looks cooler§r, but its your choice.\n\nEach §aEnergy Hatch§r increases the reactor\u0027s power buffer. §2You cannot use 4x or 16x Energy Hatches in Fusion Reactors. §aAll 16 Energy Hatches§r are required to be able to process all Mark 1 recipes and give a power buffer of §e160M EU§r. §2However, not all energy hatches are needed to be connected to power. For example, a recipe that requires LuV power draw would only need one or more hatches connected to power, but a recipe that needs ZPM power draw would need two hatches connected to power. §cThey still need to be present on the structure!§r\n\nIn addition to the recipe power drain, Fusion Reactors have a §eheat§r mechanic related to the recipe\u0027s §e\"Eu to Start\"§r. This amount of power is drained from the reactor\u0027s buffer before starting the recipe to heat up the reactor to the necessary temperature, and is independent of the recipe\u0027s EU/t cost. As such, this determines the minimum tier of reactor you need for a recipe.\n\nIf the reactor stops processing, it will §erapidly lose heat§r, even if you pause it with a soft hammer. On the other hand, if the reactor is already at the required temperature for a recipe, §eno additional power§r is required to heat up the reactor! This is true even if you switch between different recipes. This mechanic incentivizes continuous use of the reactor.\n\nIf you switch to a recipe that requires more heat, §eonly the difference§r in heat values is consumed as EU to reach the target heat (up to a maximum heat equal to the reactor\u0027s current buffer).\n\nFusion Reactors §2overclock, but only once per fusion tier, instead of based on energy input.§r They gate the next tier of materials, so you will eventually want to make more than one.",

While this reactor may seem very expensive, it will be worth it, and you will probably expand it soon.\n\nThis reactor is capable of running any Low-Enriched fuel, such as TBU and LEU-235. This is a basic reactor and can be expanded, following the same pattern, to run faster. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.\n\nFirst, set up your 150 §6Fission Reactor Casings§r to encase a 5x5x5 cube shape of empty air. Any of these reactor casings can be changed to §6Transparent Fission Reactor Casings§r. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 5x5x5 space.\n\nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in an alternating pattern, with the reactor cells at the corners, and spaces between each one. Alternate between each row, creating a grid pattern. Fill in the §6Cryotheum Coolers§r between, in the empty holes. Do this for every layer, alternating between §6Cryotheum Coolers§r on the corners and §6Reactor Cells§r on the corners. You should have the perfect amount of §6Reactor Cells§r and §6Cryotheum Coolers§r for this, and the third and final layers should be the same as the first one. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.\n\nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.\n\nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

Covers are \"upgrades\" that you can put on any GregTech machine, chest, or drum to expand its functionality. These are seperate on each side of the machine, meaning you can have up to six different covers! To work with covers, you\u0027ll need to make yourself a §aScrewdriver§r to configure covers, and a §aCrowbar§r to remove covers without having to break the machine. This quest accepts a §aScrewdriver§r and §aCrowbar§r made from any material.\n\n§eMost covers also have a ULV version, offering a cheaper alternative to LV covers in early game, though they operate slightly slower.§r\n\nHere\u0027s a list of some covers there are in the game, and what they do:\n\n- §lConveyor§r: transfers items continuously to or from an adjacent inventory.\n\n- §lPump§r: is much like a §aConveyor§r, but for fluids.\n\n- §lRobotic Arm§r: is much like §aConveyor§r, but has two additional modes:\n* §eKeep Exact§r: moves items to keep a stock of at most the specified number of items\n* §eSupply Exact§r: transfers precisely the specified number of items per operation.\nThis cover is very useful for crafting automation.\n\n- §lFluid Regulator§r: is like a §aRobotic Arm§r, but works with fluids instead of items.\n\n- §lShutter§r: prevents automation from interacting with a specific side of a machine.\n\n- §lDetector§r: Available in §aItem§r, §aFluid§r, §aEnergy§r, and §aActivity§r flavours. Emits a Redstone signal depending on the status of whatever it\u0027s detecting.\n\n- §lAdvanced Detectors§r: Available as §aItem§r, §aFluid§r, §aEnergy§r, or §aActivity§r, these covers can emit redstone in more ways than their normal counterparts. Specifically, the §aItem§r, §aFluid§r, and §aEnergy§r advanced detectors can emit a latched redstone signal based on the amount of item/fluid between a set min and max, or they can emit redstone signals proportional to the amount of item/fluids between a set min and max. The §aAdvanced Activity Detector§r emits redstone proportional to a machines progress on a recipe\n\n- §lDigital Interface§r: A graphical display for the machine\u0027s current status. Can display things like contained fluids, energy levels, etc.\n\nCovers that move items or fluids can have a §aFilter§r placed inside them. These modify the functionality of covers in ways explained in their own quests.",

Holders must be encoded in the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r.\n\nIn the vast majority of situations you\u0027ll need two identically-encoded Holders, as the following machines work together.\n\nThe §3Packager§r is a machine that compresses ingredients for a specific recipe into a set of §6Recipe Packages§r. Each package in a set can hold up to 9 stacks of ingredient items. A simple recipe might consist of one package, but a complex recipe can have up to 9 packages in its set (for 81 total item stacks). Packagers can be placed §eanywhere§r on the ME network, as they output produced packages §eback into the ME System§r.\n\nThe §3Unpackager§r is a machine that extracts ingredient items from complete sets of Recipe Packages made in a Packager, ejecting the items into an adjacent inventory. It will only extract the items if §eall packages in a set are present§r.\n\nWhen both a Packager and Unpackager are connected to an ME Network and have the same recipe, the resulting item will appear as craftable in your §aTerminal§r.\n\n§3Packager Extensions§r will act like a clone of an adjacent Packager - including access to patterns in its Package Recipe Holder - allowing you to craft recipe packages faster. Simply place the Packager Extensions around the Packager. Up to 26 extensions in a 3x3x3 cube around the Packager are supported.",

But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.\n\nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no \"Gallium Ore\" or \"Arsenic Ore\". You get §6Gallium§r and §6Arsenic §ras a byproduct from processing other ores.\n\nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you\u0027ll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §6Ore Byproduct Page§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing \u0027U\u0027 on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts.\n\nThe relevant machines are as follows:\n\n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.\n\n- §3Ore Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and 1/3 of a byproduct dust. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. §2You can also perform a simple wash with this similar to Cauldron washing, which is extremely fast, but grants no byproducts.§r\n\n- §3Chemical Bath§r: §2uses Sodium Persulfate or Mercury to purify certain ores, granting a chance to yield a full pile of a byproduct.\n\n§r- §3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing 1/9 byproduct dust.\n\n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process. §2Be warned that certain dusts may be better to directly smelt instead of electrolyze!§r\n\n- §3Thermal Centrifuge§r: not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge. §2Less slow and power-hungry now, but still so. However, it yields 1/3 byproduct dust, and macerating the Centrifuged Ore can grant a special third byproduct.\n\n§2- Sifter: filters high-quality Gems from Purified Crushed gem Ores for an overall higher yield.\n\n- Electromagnetic Separator: filters magnetic metals from certain ores, increasing their yields.§r\n\nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.",

You\u0027ll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you\u0027re automating.\n\nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.\n\nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?\n\nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.\n\nThere\u0027s some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won\u0027t be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn\u0027t try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn\u0027t have room for all fluid outputs§r.\n\nWhen you get access to them, it\u0027s probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces.

Next, move your cursor to another blockspace to see a preview of the final structure. §6Right-click§r again on the desired ending block to actually build the shape from blocks in your inventory.\n\nMost shapes are flat and are defined using a starting and ending location, but 3D shapes have a third location to complete the shape. Some special modes also have §eoptions§r, like making a §ehollow cube§r instead of a §efilled cube§r.\n\nIf you made a mistake, you can use the §aUndo§r button in the menu to break the blocks you just placed so you can collect them and try again.\n\nTo change building modes, just open the menu with §6Alt§r as before and pick a different one.

Just remember that channels are disabled by default in this pack.\n\nBy now, you should have §6ME Interfaces, §6Molecular Assemblers, Crafting Units, Patterns§r and a §6Pattern Terminal§r.\n\nFirst, for all crafts, you\u0027ll need a §eCrafting CPU§r. These are structures that must be in a rectangular prism, and can be only one block. These compose of:\n* §6Crafting Storages§r, which determine how big a craft can be. For now, §64K Crafting Storages§r should be enough. You must have at least one per CPU.\n* §6Co-Processing Units§r, which are used to craft multiple things at once. These are optional.\n* §6Crafting Monitors§r, used to see what is crafting. Not needed, and you can right-click on the CPU to find out what is crafting anyways, so this is pretty much just decoration.\n* §6Crafting Units§r, which aren\u0027t needed at all, and are just used to fill holes, if you have a lack of materials.\n\nSecond, you\u0027ll need the place for the autocrafting. For Crafting Table recipes, you\u0027ll need §6Molecular Assemblers§r. §6Interfaces§r are placed next to them. Autocrafting with §bGregTech§r is explained later, in the quest following this one.\n\nFinally, you\u0027ll need a §6Pattern§r. In order to make this, put empty §6Patterns§r in the §6Pattern Terminal§r, and find the recipe in §bJEI§r, while still in the §6Pattern Terminal§r. Then, click \u0027+\u0027 in §bJEI§r, and press the arrow to encode the recipe. This goes in the §6Interface§r that you set up in the last step. You can use §6Interface Terminals§r to access §6Interfaces\u0027§r pattern slots.\n\nEventually, you\u0027ll need a lot of §6Patterns§r, lots of CPUs, and ones with more storage, and lots of §6Interfaces§r. If you run out of pattern slots in an §6Interface§r, you can add more §6Interfaces§r, or use newly added §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r, which add 9 slots each. You can have a maximum of 3 §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r in an §6Interface§r, which makes the amount of pattern slots go to 36.\n\nNote that you can recycle your CPUs by simply placing them in a §eCrafting Grid§r.",

You can have as many Wireless Terminals or their varients on the system at the same time.\n\nFinally, put your §6Wireless Terminal§r into the §6Security Terminal§r. This will connect it to the system.\n\nYou can equip these as a bauble, and use a hotkey to open them. Search \u0027Applied Energistics\u0027 as a §ecategory§r to see and edit these hotkeys.\n\nYou can only go 16 blocks away. However, you can put §6Wireless Boosters§r into the §6Wireless Access Point§r to increase the range.

There is no limit on how many P2P tunnels, or P2P tunnel systems, you can have on one network.\n\nBy default, a P2P tunnel is an §6ME tunnel§r, which transmits Applied Energistics channels and power. Since channels are disabled, you will most likely not be using the default tunnel. You can change the mode of your P2P tunnels by using the assembler recipes or by §asneak-scrolling§r with the P2P tunnel in hand.\n\nTo configure your P2P tunnels, take a §6Memory Card§r. While holding the memory card, §ashift-right click§r the unconfigured tunnel, to set the frequency of the input, and save the frequency to the memory card. Once the first tunnel has been set up this way and the memory card is configured with the frequency, any subsequent tunnel you §aright-click§r with the memory card will be set as the output of the most recent frequency used. Alternatively, you can set a P2P tunnel as an §einput§r by §aright-clicking§r the tunnel with the §ecard in your off-hand§r.\n\nYou can also use memory cards to copy the configuration of ME blocks and tile-entities, such as §6Interfaces§r and §6Storage Buses§r. §aShift-right click§r a ME block to copy its configuration, and §aright-click§r to paste that configuration. Note that this doesn\u0027t copy upgrades applied to the block.\n\nYou can also §ashift-right click§r to empty the frequency, or the ME block configuration, set in the card.",

Data on how to craft each item is stored in a §6Data Stick§r and read by a §aData Access Hatch§r. This data is required to craft §6LuV components§r, the §3Fusion Reactor§r, and some parts from §dDraconic Evolution§r.\n\nTo begin, craft a §3Scanner§r and a few §6Data Sticks§r. The initial Scanner recipes run at §6HV§r, but §1IV§r is required relatively soon so might as well make that one.\n\nPress §bR§r on the item you want to craft in the and navigate to the §bScanner tab§r. This will tell you which item needs to be scanned to make the data for the new item. For example, §dLuV §6Electric Motors§r will require an §1IV §6Electric Motor§r to be scanned.\n\nPlace a §6Data Stick§r with the item to be scanned in the §3Scanner§r. The item will be §cconsumed§r and its data will be written to the §6Data Stick§r. Each §6Data item§r can only hold a §csingle recipe§r.\n\nFinally, place the §6Data Stick§r into the §aData Access Hatch§r of your §3Assembly Line§r. It will now be able to craft that item.\n\nLater, you will need more advanced §6Data Orbs§r and §6Data Modules§r to store data, and a §3Data Bank§r to read them.\n\nIf you need to create duplicate Data items, you can copy the data to a blank data item of the same type using the Scanner.",

The amount of §dComputation Work§r it provides depends on the type of HPCA parts within it. It also needs to receive adequate §dCooling§r provided by Coolers within its structure.\n\nConnect the §3Computation Data Transmission Hatch§r to the §3Reception Hatch§r on your §3Research Station§r to transfer the §dCWU/t§r produced to it.\n\nThe HPCA accepts almost any combination of §3Computation Components§r, §3Coolers§r, §3Bridges§r and §3Empty Components§r within the 3x3 area behind the §aComputer Heat Vents§r. This quest will build a §d16 CWU/t§r HPCA, enough for scanning the §3Fusion Reactor Mk2§r, §6UV Circuits§r, and all §6ZPM Components§r. You can get away with less at first, but you will eventually need to upgrade to this computing power. Refer to §eJEI§r for some other possible setups.\n\nThe §dCWU/t§r of the HPCA is determined by the sum of the outputs of the §3HPCA Computation Components§r within it. Regular §3Computation Components§r produce §d4 CWU/t§r each, and require §d2 Cooling§r each. §3Advanced Computation Components§r, which you do not have access to yet, produce §d16 CWU/t§r each and require §d4 Cooling§r each, and a fully upgraded HPCA can produce up to §d36 CWU/t§r.\n\n§dCooling§r is provided by §3Cooler§r blocks within the structure. §3Passive Coolers§r provide §d1 Cooling§r each for free, whereas §3Active Coolers§r provide §d2 Cooling§r each with a steady flow of §9Dielectric PCB Coolant§r, provided through an §3Input Hatch§r. If the Cooling within the HPCA is insufficient, the components may be §cdamaged§r from overheating. The physical position of the components within the HPCA does not matter.\n\nA §3Bridge Component§r may be installed, allowing the HPCA to connect to §3Network Switches§r.\n\nThe energy consumption of the HPCA is determined by the sum of its parts. \u0027Max Energy\u0027 refers to the power draw while the HPCA is computing, while \u0027Upkeep Energy\u0027 refers to the power draw when the HPCA is idling.",
