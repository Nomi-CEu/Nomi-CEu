nomifactory.quest.normal.line.11.desc=A chapter to help you with processing, both complex and straightforward!

#db 0 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.0.title=Charging Quartz
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.0.desc=The main purpose for this device is to turn §6Certus Quartz§r into §6Charged Certus Quartz Crystals§r.%n%nThis device can be powered with RF via energy conduits or use AE energy from a network via ME conduits or cables.%n%nIt accepts power from two sides. Which two sides? It's pretty easy to guess.%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nOk, ok. It's the top and bottom.%n%n

#db 1 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1.title=Crystal Growth Chamber
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1.desc=The §3Crystal Growth Chamber§r allows you to perform §bApplied Energistics§r's world crafting recipes inside of a machine. Hooray, you never have to drop more things in water again!%n%nIt is used for growing §6Crystal Seeds§r into §6Pure Crystals§r, and also for creating §6Fluix Crystals§r.%n%nJEI doesn't show the Chamber's recipes directly, so we'll explain it here:%n%nSeeds are made by pulverizing any of the three crystal types and mixing the dust with sand. A seed grows into the corresponding Pure Crystal, which is substitutable for the original crystal in most recipes. Using Pure Crystals lets you effectively double your material efficiency, which is nice. And no, you can't grind down Pure Crystals to further multiply your resources. Sorry.%n%nFluix Crystals you've already had to make in a pool of water by now, and it's the same ingredients here: insert one each of a §6Redstone§r, §6Charged Certus Quartz Crystal§r, and a §6Nether Quartz§r to produce two Fluix Crystals.

#db 2 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.2.title=Canning Machine and Assorted Stuff
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.2.desc=Note: this quest accepts both LV and MV Canning Machines.%n%n§aLV Batteries§r were very simple to make, but more effective forms of power storage will be more complex to build, so we'll need to lay the groundwork now.%n%nPut your §3Centrifuge§r to work for the §6Antimony§r you'll need, which comes in tiny piles from processing §6Tetrahedrite Ore§r and §6Stibnite Ore§r.%n%n

#db 3 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.3.title=§2Genesis
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.3.desc=Welcome to §5Nomifactory§f §2GTCEu Edition§r!%n%nThis pack is intended to be played in a §bLost Cities / Overworld dimension§f.%n%nIf you're playing with friends, don't forget to invite them to the §equestbook party§f.%n%n§fIf you wish to build your base in a skyblock world, place the §6Void World Cake§f down on the ground, and eat a slice to be sent to the void. Please note that you'll still need to return to the Lost Cities / Overworld dimension to mine, but you can freely build in complete safety in the §eVoid World§f.%n%nFeatures new to §2CEu§r and quests with new content will be highlighted in §2dark green (colour 2)§r.

#db 4 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.4.title=Iron Supply
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Nomifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. §2The upgraded HV Electric Prospector's Scanner you were given will tell you the types of ores you can find within a 7x7 chunk area!%n§r%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, the quest book will later guide you towards making §2an HV Battery§r to charge §aHV tools §rin your inventory.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired with §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangeable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

#db 5 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.5.title=Mining Hammers
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.5.desc=§aMining Hammers§r offer a relatively cheap way to mine out areas much faster. They clear a 3x3 of blocks (unless you're crouching) and mine quickly.%n%n§2GTCEu now has Mining Hammers natively! You can craft them with any GT tool material. §r%n%nYour free 4 Diamond Mining Hammers should last you a while, and you can always fix them using an anvil and some diamonds.

#db 6 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.6.title=§2More Materials
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.6.desc=Before you continue, you'll need access to some more materials. %n%n§6Redstone§f: Found only deep in the world, in massive veins paired with §6Cinnabar§f and §6Ruby§f.%n%n§6Copper§f: Two primary sources. §6Tetrahedrite§f veins are higher up, while §6Chalcopyrite§f veins are lower, paired with some small amounts of §6Iron§f. You'll also find §6Malachite§f inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§f: Found essentially at ground level. §6Cassiterite§f is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is §2removed.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

#db 7 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.7.title=§2Cables
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.7.desc=The most basic cables, such as these §6Red Alloy Cables§f, can be wrapped in their §6Rubber§f insulation by hand.%n%nMore advanced types of cables will require an §3Assembling Machine§f and liquid §9Rubber§f, but you can do it the simple way for now.%n%n§2CEu has GT6-style pipes and cables on by default. §rYou will need to use §aWire Cutters§r to connect each side of a cable to machines or other cables. Placing it against the machine or cable automatically connects it as well. The same behaviour follows for GT pipes, whose tool is the §aWrench§r.%nThis can save you from energy or fluids going the wrong way. But if you don't like this, disable the config option for "GT6 style pipes and cables" in the GregTech config file.%n%n§2GT cables now support RF conversion natively! §rYou can plug an §dRF§r machine into an §dEU§r cable directly and it will convert the energy.%n

#db 8 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.8.title=The Third Tier Three Circuits
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.8.desc=With three §6Microcircuits§r and some standard components, you can upgrade to the penultimate Tier Three circuit: a §6Microprocessor§r.

#db 9 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.9.title=§2Ore Doubling?
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Nomifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials or anything you buy with §dNomicoins §fbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have the §2Steam Grinder§r§e, or Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

#db 10 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.10.title=§2Tier Two Micro Miner
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.10.desc=The Second Micro Miner! §2You'll need that Phosphorous in the LV Field Generators.§r%n%nThis uses an §bExtended Crafting§r table so it's not possible to automate the Miner itself with §bApplied Energistics 2§r just yet (this requires more advanced technology not easy to access until the Tier Four Micro Miner). You can make it semi-automatically by prestocking the components you need, and filling up the Extended Crafting Table with §bJEI§r!%n%nThis Micro Miner can get you:§6%n* Bauxite Ore%n§2* Pyrochlore Ore§6%n* Copper Ore%n§2* Sphalerite Ore§r%n§6* Cassiterite Ore%n* Scheelite Ore%n* Tungstate Ore%n* Radium Salt§r%n%nAs well as the §6Stellar Creation Data§r, which will be useful much, much later.%n%n§2A new mission is available in CEu. This mission costs HV Electric Pumps and Cryotheum Dust. This nets you Solidified Neon, Xenon and Krypton, although it is better to get those from distilling Liquid Nether and Ender Air, as of the useful byproducts you get, and the tiny amount of each element you get in this mission.

#db 11 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.11.title=§2Electronics Subcomponents
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%n§2CEu circuit progression means you also have to put wires on your substrates for them to be usable. In this case, use some Fine Copper Wires.§r%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Crafting Station§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

#db 12 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a §6Iron tool §rof the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool's material in the recipes: it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not plates). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress. This quest accepts any tool material.

#db 13 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.13.title=Batch Crafting In Style
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item only when you need it, you'll go insane. It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§f frequently used items so you don't have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§f all at once.%n%n§3Crafting Stations§f are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.%n%nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.%n%nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.%n%nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.%n%nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.

#db 14 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.14.title=Furnace v2.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.14.desc=§3Iron Furnaces§f can smelt an item in §a150 ticks§f, which is somewhat faster than a vanilla §6Furnace§f, which takes §a200 ticks§f. The fuel efficiency remains the same for all furnaces.

#db 15 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.15.title=Furnace v3.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.15.desc=§3Copper Furnaces§f are another step up in speed, taking §a100 ticks§f to smelt an item.

#db 16 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.16.title=Furnace v4.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.16.desc=§3Silver Furnaces§f are another step up in speed, taking a mere §a60 ticks§f to smelt an item.

#db 17 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.17.title=Furnace v5.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.17.desc=§3Gold Furnaces§f are yet another step up in speed, taking only §a40 ticks§f to smelt an item.

#db 18 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.18.title=Furnace v7.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.18.desc=While §3Obsidian Furnaces§f are the same speed as §3Diamond Furnaces§f, they have twice the throughput since they can §esmelt two items at once§f.%n%nYou may find that Diamond Furnaces suit your needs better than Obsidian, but they'll both be crafting ingredients in various machines soon enough, so crafting one is not a waste, even if you don't use it.

#db 19 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.19.title=LV Alloy Smelter
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.19.desc=Alloy Smelters are used to create alloys by melting and reforming items together.%n%nNow you won't need to grind up metals into dusts and mix them for alloy dusts! Plus, many of the more complex alloys you couldn't make that way are now possible.

#db 20 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.20.title=Furnace v6.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.20.desc=§3Diamond Furnaces§f are the fastest available, taking only §a25 ticks§f to smelt an item.

#db 21 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.21.title=§2Steel
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.21.desc=You already have §6Steel§r, but it can be made much faster in the §3Alloy Smelter§r, at the cost of EU.%n%nYou might want to save your §6Coal Dust§r for circuits and use §6Charcoal Dust§r instead. Later, you can also process either of these dusts, §6Coal Coke Dust§r, §2or Diamond Dust§r into §6Carbon Dust§r, which can be used for Steel and other useful things.

#db 22 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.22.title=§2Pyrolyse Oven
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.22.desc=The main function of this oven is to increase the fuel values of your wood and coal while also recovering some of the various potentially useful waste products.%n%nTurning §6Coal§r into §6Coal Coke§r will not only make it more useful as fuel, but will also produce §9Phenol§r, which you'll need for circuits.%n%nThe Pyrolyse Oven is also the source of several other fluids that can be distilled for useful ingredients.%n%nRemember that Hatches and Buses can be replaced by Hatches and Buses of any tier, although the Input Bus must be at least LV, as there are 2 inputs, and that you can  §6sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.%n%n§2As stated in the tooltip, higher tier coils will make this faster.%n

#db 23 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.23.title=Obsidian
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.23.desc=You'll need §6Obsidian§r to make §6Dark Steel§r. Most of the tools you can make cannot mine Obsidian, but you do have a few potential options for ones that will work. The options you're most likely to have access to at this point are:%n%n1) A §aDiamond Pickaxe§r or §aDiamond Mining Hammer§r.%n%n2) A §aPlatinum Mining Hammer§r (not pickaxe though).%n%nLater. you can use a §3Rock Breaker§r at voltage §aHV§r or higher to make §6Obsidian§r without spending §6Lava§r!

#db 24 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.24.title=Steam Dynamo
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.24.desc=Your first major crafting project!%n%nYou'll need a small bit of §6Silver§f for this dynamo. If you haven't found a §6Galena vein§f yet (which is where Silver is), then consider "buying" some §6Silver Ore§r using §dNomicoins§r. You won't need a ton of silver and lead just yet, so it won't bankrupt you.%n%nKeep in mind that §eDynamos only output power when burning through fuel, and only the block attached directly to the coil will get provided with power§f.

#db 25 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.25.title=Cake Based Dimensional Transit
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.25.desc=This quest is repeatable once per hour and gives you a free cake to the Void World or Overworld. You can also refill your cakes with the items indicated in their tooltips.

#db 26 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.26.title=Dark Steel
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.26.desc=§6Steel§r alloyed with §6Obsidian§r makes §6Dark Steel§r, which is needed for many of the machines in §bEnderIO§r and §bApplied Energistics§r.%n%nLater, you can use §6Void Crystal§r instead of Obsidian.

#db 27 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.27.title=LV Chemical Reactor
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.27.desc=The place for your very first chemical reactions, namely making some improved substrates.

#db 28 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.28.title=Pulsating Dust
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.28.desc=§6Pulsating Dust§r is a mysterious magical material that taps into the power of Ender. It has all sorts of strange and potentially dangerous applications, including the ability to make §6Pulsating Ingots§r and §6Ender Pearls§r.%n%nYour first source of Pulsating Dust is §6Uraninite§r, which you can get from §6Uraninite Ore§r. Later on, you'll be able to produce Pulsating Dust by smelting §6Resonant Clathrates§r.%n%n§cPlease note that the Enderpearl Dust electrolysis recipe requires an EV Electrolyzer, and is most likely not worth it.§r

#db 29 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.29.title=Pulsating Iron and Ender Pearls
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.29.desc=A mysterious alloy, made from §6Pulsating Dust§r and §6Iron§r.%n%nIf you can't find one otherwise, §6Ender Pearls§r can be crafted using Pulsating Dust and a §6Diamond§r in an §3Alloy Smelter§r.

#db 30 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.30.title=Electrical Steel
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.30.desc=A refined type of steel, made from §6Silicon Dust§r and §6Steel§r.%n%nThis material is frequently used in electronics and digital equipment.

#db 31 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.31.title=Vibrant Capacitor Bank
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.31.desc=Two §aAdvanced Capacitor Banks§r can be grafted together with a §6Vibrant Crystal§r and §6Vibrant Alloy Plates§r to create a §aVibrant Capacitor Bank§r, which stores five times as much RF as the advanced bank, for a total of twenty-five times as much as the basic bank.

#db 32 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.32.title=Advanced Capacitor Bank
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.32.desc=Two §aCapacitor Banks§r can be grafted together with a §6Double-Layer Capacitor§r and §6Electrical Steel§r to create an §aAdvanced Capacitor Bank§r, which stores five times as much RF as the basic bank.

#db 33 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.33.title=Basic Capacitor Bank
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.33.desc=Expandable multi-block storage for RF power.%n%nThis first tier isn't much, but you can upgrade them over time to hold substantial amounts of power.

#db 34 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.34.title=§2Energetic Alloy
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.34.desc=This alloy is made from §2mixing 2 Gold Dust, 1 Redstone, and 1 Glowstone Dust in a Mixer, creating Energetic Alloy Dust,§r and putting it in your new §3Electric Blast Furnace§r.%n%nThrow §2the prepared dust into the input bus§r and in twenty seconds your §6Energetic Alloy Ingot§r will be in the output bus.%n%n§2In EV Age, you can build an Alloy Blast Smelter which doubles the yield.

#db 35 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.35.title=§2Vibrant Alloy
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.35.desc=Another alloy.%n%n§2In EV Age, you can build an Alloy Blast Smelter which doubles the yield.

#db 37 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.37.title=Rubber Sheets
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.37.desc=Going out in search of a §6Rubber Tree§f is a viable option for sure. However, if this isn't appealing, you can also §eshear leaves§f and make §6Plantballs§f out of them. Plantballs smelt into §6Slime§f, and Slime smelts into §6Rubber§f.%n%nYou'll want to transition to Rubber Trees at some point, though, since the §eratio of leaves to rubber is quite poor§f.%n%nRubber can be hammered into sheets just like metals can be turned to plates. It's quite inefficient to do it this way, but such is the life of early game §bGregTech§f. At least rubber isn't particularly hard to come by.

#db 38 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.38.title=§2LV Power
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.38.desc=§oNote: this quest accepts any §2§oLV Energy Converter§r§o.%n%n§rUntil now you have been generating §aRF power§r with your §3Steam Dynamos§r, but §bGregTech§r machines require §aEU power§r. With your first §6circuit§r in hand, you are ready to build a §eLow Voltage (LV) §3§2Energy Converter§r.%n%nThe §2Energy Converter§r is a special device that §econverts §2between §aRF power§r and §aEU power§r. They come in §2four sizes: 1A, 4A, 8A, and 16A.%n%n§aRF§r converts into §aEU§r at a §e4 to 1 ratio§r. §a100 RF§r becomes §a25 EU§r, and vice-versa. §2Use a Soft Hammer to change the conversion direction.

#db 39 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.39.title=Item Conduits
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.39.desc=Item conduits are useful for moving items between inventories over moderate distances.%n%nCrafting them in an Assembling Machine instead of by hand gives twice as many conduits.

#db 40 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.40.title=Conductive Iron Energy Conduits
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.40.desc=The most basic tier of §aRF§r energy conduits from §bEnderIO§r.%n%nThese can be used to transport energy from your §3Steam Dynamos§r to various destinations.

The §6Launch Pad§r blocks go in a 3x3 layout flat on the ground to form the platform.%n%nThe Structure Tower§r is formed from a column of §6Structure Tower§r blocks that holds your rocket upright. The first block goes adjacent to any side of the launch pad platform (on the same Y-level as the launch pad blocks).%n%nWith 6 Structure Tower blocks, you can only build a rocket 5 blocks high, since any higher would exceed the height of the tower. To build a taller rocket, you'll need to build a taller tower using more Structure Tower blocks.%n%nThe §3Rocket Assembling Machine§r needs to be placed next to the launch pad (not on it) 1 block higher than the platform, so that the bottom of the Rocket Assembler is flush with the top of the launch pad.

If you want to use the minimum number of fluid hatches, you'll need to craft an additional §229 Fusion Machine Casings§r. In addition to the §a48 Fusion Machine Casings§r, you will also need §631 Fusion Glass§r or §631 Fusion Machne Casings§r. §bFusion Glass is cheaper, and looks cooler§r, but its your choice.%n%nEach §aEnergy Hatch§r increases the reactor's power buffer. §2You cannot use 4x or 16x Energy Hatches in Fusion Reactors. §aAll 16 Energy Hatches§r are required to be able to process all Mark 1 recipes and give a power buffer of §e160M EU§r. §2However, not all energy hatches are needed to be connected to power. For example, a recipe that requires LuV power draw would only need one or more hatches connected to power, but a recipe that needs ZPM power draw would need two hatches connected to power.§r §cThey still need to be present on the structure!§r%n%nIn addition to the recipe power drain, Fusion Reactors have a §eheat§r mechanic related to the recipe's §e"Eu to Start"§r. This amount of power is drained from the reactor's buffer before starting the recipe to heat up the reactor to the necessary temperature, and is independent of the recipe's EU/t cost. As such, this determines the minimum tier of reactor you need for a recipe.%n%nIf the reactor stops processing, it will §erapidly lose heat§r, even if you pause it with a soft hammer. On the other hand, if the reactor is already at the required temperature for a recipe, §eno additional power§r is required to heat up the reactor! This is true even if you switch between different recipes.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.350.title=Fission Reactor
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.350.desc=The full complexity of §bNuclearCraft§r is far too much for the scope of this quest guide, so §eyou're encouraged to watch a tutorial or read a guide online§r. %n%nFor the purposes of this particular quest, you'll be building a breeder reactor to make §6Plutonium§r, and other nuclear elements. While this reactor may seem very expensive, it will be worth it, and you will probably expand it soon. %n%nThis reactor is capable of running any Low-Enriched fuel, such as TBU and LEU-235. This is a basic reactor and can be expanded, following the same pattern, to run faster. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 150 §6Fission Reactor Casings§r to encase a 5x5x5 cube shape of empty air. Any of these reactor casings can be changed to §6Transparent Fission Reactor Casings§r. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 5x5x5 space.%n%nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in an alternating pattern, with the reactor cells at the corners, and spaces between each one. Alternate between each row, creating a grid pattern. Fill in the §6Cryotheum Coolers§r between, in the empty holes. Do this for every layer, alternating between §6Cryotheum Coolers§r on the corners and §6Reactor Cells§r on the corners. You should have the perfect amount of §6Reactor Cells§r and §6Cryotheum Coolers§r for this, and the third and final layers should be the same as the first one. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.%n%nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.%n%nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

The next time you order an item, the ME Interface will push ingredients into the machine, and the machine will push outputs back into the Interface once they're ready, completing the craft. No need to use conduits or import buses!%n%nFurthermore, you can use Blocking Mode, which ensures that no items are in the inventory before placing the items in, which is a handy way to prevent conflicts. Even better, blocking mode now ignores Programmable Circuits and Molds! Please note that non-consumable items should stay in the machine, and not be included in the pattern made.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.727.title=§2Ore Processing for Byproducts
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.727.desc=When you first started the pack, we told you that ore doubling can wait, and that's true... But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.%n%nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no "Gallium Ore" or "Arsenic Ore". You get §6Gallium§r and §6Arsenic §ras a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §6Ore Byproduct Page§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing 'U' on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. %n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Ore Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. §2You can also perform a simple wash with this similar to Cauldron washing, which is extremely fast, but grants no byproducts.§r%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: §2uses Sodium Persulfate or Mercury to purify certain ores, granting a chance to yield a full pile of a byproduct.%n%n§r- §3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed §21 (nerfed from 3) tiny pile of byproduct§r.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process. §2Be warned that certain dusts may be better to directly smelt instead of electrolyze!§r%n%n- §3Thermal Centrifuge§r: not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge. §2Less slow and power-hungry now, but still so. However, it yields 3 additional tiny piles of byproduct, and macerating the Centrifuged Ore can grant a special third byproduct.%n%n§2- Sifter: filters high-quality Gems from Purified Crushed gem Ores for an overall higher yield.%n%n- Electromagnetic Separator: filters magnetic metals from certain ores, increasing their yields.§r%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.728.desc=§oThis is an important part of a Processing Line. Visit the Processing Lines Tab to have more info, useful tips and a visual representation of how to passively automate this.%n%n§6Uraninite Ore§r is the first source of §6Pulsating Dust§r but is not a very good one in the long term. Instead you should make §6Resonant Clathrates§r, which are an infinitely-renewable and effective source of Pulsating Dust.%n%nResonant Clathrates are made by melting §6Ender Pearls§r with a §3Fluid Extractor§r into §9Resonant Ender§r, then mixing that with §6Nether Quartz§r in an MV or better §3Chemical Reactor§r. Smelting this clathrate gives Pulsating Dust.%n%nWith Resonant Clathrates now accessible, everything you need for crafting §6Pulsating Polymer Clay§r can be automated in a net-positive loop.§r Doing so is the first step in automation of §bDeep Mob Evolution§r, which is §ea primary source of important materials for the rest of the pack§r.%n%nThe exact implementation is up to you.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.729.title=Fluid Interface
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.729.desc=This is the fluid counterpart to the standard §aME Interface§r.%n%nFluids inserted into it are automatically digitized into the network, though it does have internal storage that can back up if you run out of space.%n%nYou can configure the interface to stock up to §2nine§r different fluids (or for faster throughput later on, several tanks of the same fluid). You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

#db 730 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.730.title=Fluids and Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.730.desc=Working with fluids is a bit tricky. AE2 §aPatterns§r have no notion of fluids, meaning that you have to §ededicate separate machines to specific fluid combinations§r, ensuring they remain stocked.%n%nAE2 has a §aFluid Import Bus§r and §aFluid Export Bus§r, and this is the usual go-to for players experienced with AE2. A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump§r or a §aFluid Regulator§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and §aFluid Filters§r can allow routing specific fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For machines from other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

#db 731 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.731.title=Fluid Logistics
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them. An alternative to this is storage buses on §3Gregtech Tanks and Drums§r.%n%n

It can also collect leaves if you want it to.%n%nLike other §bEnderIO§r machines, it requires an §6RF capacitor§r. The quality of capacitor affects the overall size of the farm as well as the speed and energy at which it operates.%n%nYou can configure which crops or tree types will be planted relative to the Farming Station by placing the crop or sapling in the various quadrants in the GUI. Clicking the lock button will ensure that the stack placed there won't be completely consumed, as that could lead to plants migrating to other quadrants.%n%nIn addition to power, the Farming Station§r requires specific §etools§r (and usually a supply of §9Water§r) to operate. If you're missing anything, the machine will refuse to operate and displays a message over itself to let you know.%n%nFor planting §6crops§r or §6saplings§r, you need a §aHoe§r.%nFor chopping §6trees§r, you need an §aAxe§r.

When used in a §6Robot Arm§r, §aItem Filters§r make for a powerful automation tool for §ekeeping specific items in stock§r in specific quantities in Machines. With §6Fluid Regulators§r, similar behavior is possible with fluids using a §aFluid Filter§r. For §6Conveyors§r and §6Pumps§r, it simply limits what that cover will move.%n%n§aFilters§r all have 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes, and can be applied to multiple sides of machines. When placed inside a §6Robot Arm§r in §eKeep Exact§r or §eSupply Exact§r mode§r, the item count in a filter can be incremented by §eRight Clicking§r and decremented by §eLeft Clicking§r. Holding §eShift§r causes the count to increase/decrease by a factor of 2. This controls the number of each type of item that will be kept in stock or moved at a time.%n%nSimilar controls are available for the §aFluid Filter§r when placed inside a §6Fluid Regulator§r.%n%nAdditionally, the §aOre Dictionary Filter§r§r is a powerful tool that has a specialized filter which uses ore dictionary entries and §2uses regular expressions (regex)§r, e. g. "§6ingotHot*§r" will match all hot ingots, "§6dustRegular*§r" will match all regular dusts, and "§6dustTiny*§r" will match all tiny piles.%n%nAll §bGregTech§r Filters can be configured using ghost items from §bJEI§r.

It of course works on single-block machines, but can also be used on §eMultiblock Controllers§r like your §3Electronic Blast Furnace§r. But it's even more flexible than that: you can use it on any §bGregTech§r block that accepts transfer covers, as long as the controllable cover is placed on it first! This means it also works for things like §6Chests§r, §6Drums§r, and Multiblock inputs.%n%nThe cover works by detecting a §eredstone signal§r. By default, the entire machine will be disabled if a sufficiently strong signal is detected by the cover.%n%nWhen you open the Machine Controller's GUI with a §aScrewdriver§r, you will see several options for configuring its behavior:%n%nThe strength of the signal required to trigger the Machine Controller is configurable using the top slider.%n%nAnother button allows you to select whether to control the whole machine (where applicable) or a specific cover. This lets you do things like stop moving items into a machine, but also allow the machine to continue working.%n%nSwitching from §eNormal§r to §eInverted§r mode will make the Machine Controller instead disable the machine until it receives the requisite redstone signal. This is often preferable when working with §6Level Emitters§r to prevent machines from starting up if your §eME Network§r is offline.%n%nSome use cases:%n• Control machines through vanilla redstone contraptions or a simple lever.%n%n• The §6Redstone Upgrades§r from §bStorage Drawers§r can be used when outputting into a drawer to make the drawer emit redstone that can control the machine.%n%n• When you progress to digital storage, an §6ME Level Emitter§r or §6ME Fluid Level Emitter§r can be used to emit signal based on specific items or fluids in your network.%n

This is why the §6Processing Array§r has an astounding Hatch limit, and can support up to §e4 Energy Inputs§r on the structure. This allows you to get the needed 16 Amps of power to the machine from a single tier-appropriate §3CEF§r.%n%nProcessing Arrays distribute their buffered power at the appropriate voltage, so there's no danger of your machines exploding if you, for example, operate 16 HV machines off one amp of IV power.%n%nBecause the required number of Inputs, Outputs, and Casings is highly variable, this quest only asks you to craft the §6Processing Array Controller§r and the §aMachine Access Interface§r. Make sure your buses and hatches are large enough to hold the ingredients and outputs for the number of parallel crafts you're attempting, and that you're providing enough power for all those machines!%n%nAn advanced feature of the Processing Array is §eDistinct Bus Mode§r.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.809.desc=The §3Simulation Supercomputer§r is a multiblock structure that performs §bDeep Mob Evolution§r simulations like the §3Simulation Chamber§r, but is capable of overclocking these simulations to incredible speeds.%n%nOne of these structures can perform the equivalent work of hundreds of individual Simulation Chambers more efficiently. This will make it far easier to generate pristine matter you'll need for things like §6Dragon Lair Data§r. You'll probably need several §3Loot Fabricators§r to keep up with it.%n%nThe data model you place in the input bus will §2have a fixed 30%% chance of producing Pristine matter regardless of its tier. §eOverclocking does not alter the chances of pristines§r: those come at fixed rates per iteration.%n%nAs a §dCreative Tier§r structure, it is rather expensive to make.

Furthermore, although each quest can be completed via a checkbox, all quests in a processing line will auto-complete once you get the item positioned on the right. Either the checkbox or achieving the product will complete the quests.%n%n§oYou may have to hold the item for a few seconds for the whole line to auto-complete.%n%nThis is not complete, and is published out for testing purposes. Currently, only Pulsating Polymer Clay and Cobbleworks are implemented, but more chains are to come. These are Polyethylene and Polyvinyl Chloride, Oil Processing, Epoxy Resin, Rocket Fuel, Polytetrafluoroethylene, High-Octane Gasoline, Cetane-Boosted Diesel, Polybenzimidazole, Naquadah Processing and Platinum Group Processing. If you have any suggestions on other chains or on how to improve this tab, feel free to DM Integer Limit#0458 on Discord or create an issue on GitHub.

These are structures that must be in a rectangular prism, and can be only one block. These compose of:%n* §6Crafting Storages§r, which determine how big a craft can be. For now, §64K Crafting Storages§r should be enough. You must have at least one per CPU.%n* §6Co-Processing Units§r, which are used to craft multiple things at once. These are optional.%n* §6Crafting Monitors§r, used to see what is crafting.

For Crafting Table recipes, you'll need §6Molecular Assemblers§r. §6Interfaces§r are placed next to them. Autocrafting with §bGregTech§r is explained later, in the quest following this one.%n%nFinally, you'll need a §6Pattern§r. In order to make this, put empty §6Patterns§r in the §6Pattern Terminal§r, and find the recipe in §bJEI§r, while still in the §6Pattern Terminal§r. Then, click '+' in §bJEI§r, and press the arrow to encode the recipe. This goes in the §6Interface§r that you set up in the last step. You can use §6Interface Terminals§r to access §6Interfaces'§r pattern slots.%n%nEventually, you'll need a lot of §6Patterns§r, lots of CPUs, and ones with more storage, and lots of §6§6§6Interfaces§r§r§r. If you run out of pattern slots in an §6Interface§r, you can add more §6Interfaces§r, or use newly added §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r, which add 9 slots each.

Right now, it has 2 slots, but later, once you unlock §6Steel§r, you can upgrade it with §6Belt Pouches§r, all the way to 9 slots, with an §3Anvil§r and some §aXP§r!%n%nMake the Tool Belt, and you can use the keybind (default is `R'), while the belt is in your inventory or Bauble Slots §cand you are holding something, or the belt is not empty§r, to open its GUI. %n%nAlternatively, you can right click while holding the belt to open its inventory.%n%nThe Tool Belt is equipable as a §bBauble§r. Open your inventory and look for the Baubles button, and click it to reveal the additional bauble slots menu, and then put it in the Belt Slot. Or, just click in every bauble slot until it goes in, if you can't tell which bauble slot looks like a belt.%n%nThe Tool Belt can store anything with a stack size of 1, like swords, pickaxes, §bGregTech§r tools, and the §6Terminal§r. It has also been modified a bit, so it also allows any §bStorage Drawers§r key, and §cdoesn't allow any Thermal Satchel§r.%n%nNow, you can insert and extract from the belt! You can also use the Keybinds `§eCycle Tool Left§r' and `§eCycle Tool Right§r' whilst you are in the GUI.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1022.title=P2P Tunnels
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1022.desc=§oNote: This quest accepts both Memory Cards, and Advanced Memory Cards.§r%n%nA §6P2P Tunnel§r (§aPoint-to-Point Tunnel§r) is a powerful tool from §bApplied Energistics 2§r that can be used to send items, redstone, RF/EU or fluids from one location to another, using your ME system, without the need to use any disk storage space. §cTransporting RF/EU has a 5%% tax on the input energy.§r%n%nEach P2P tunnel system may have only §cone input§r but §eany number of outputs§r. There is no limit on how many P2P tunnels, or P2P tunnel systems, you can have on one network.%n%nBy default, a P2P tunnel is an §6ME tunnel§r, which transmits Applied Energistics channels and power. Since channels are disabled, you will most likely not be using the default tunnel. You can change the mode of your P2P tunnels by right clicking the tunnel with the respective item seen in §bJEI§r.%n%nTo configure your P2P tunnels, take a §6Memory Card§r. While holding the memory card, §ashift-right click§r the unconfigured tunnel, to set the frequency of the input, and save the frequency to the memory card. Once the first tunnel has been set up this way and the memory card is configured with the frequency, any subsequent tunnel you §aright-click§r with the memory card will be set as the output of the most recent frequency used.%n%nYou can also use memory cards to copy the configuration of ME blocks and tile-entities, such as §6Interfaces§r and §6Storage Buses§r. §aShift-right click§r a ME block to copy its configuration, and §aright-click§r to paste that configuration. Note that this doesn't copy upgrades applied to the block.%n%nYou can also §ashift-right click§r to empty the frequency, or the ME block configuration, set in the card.%n%nThis pack has §bBetter P2P§r, which adds the §6Advanced Memory Card§r. Using it, you can §aright-click§r on any ME device or cable that is attached to the current system. This will allow you to see all your current P2P connections without having to search for your tunnels.%n%nYou can also configure P2P tunnels using your Advanced Memory Card. While holding the card, §aright-click§r on a tunnel, it will be §aselected§r. Once a tunnel is selected, it will be highlighted in §agreen§r. You can also see your other connections with the options to select or bind; hitting select will reselect the tunnel.%n%nAn incorrect setup will show in §cred§r (Usually P2P device without input).%n%nThe §6Advanced Memory Card§r has 3 modes accessible in the §3GUI§r:%n%n§aBind Output§r:%nOnce the tunnel you would like to be set as an input has been §aselected§r, hitting §bbind§r on any other connection will turn the selected tunnel into an input tunnel, and any binded tunnels will be turned into output tunnels for the selected tunnel.%n%n§aBind Input§r:%nOnce the tunnel you would like to be set as an output has been §aselected§r, hitting §bbind§r on any other tunnel will set the tunnel as the input of the selected tunnel. This is useful for when you can’t find the output tunnel.%n %n§aCopy Output§r:%nOnce an output tunnel you want to copy has been §aselected§r, hitting §bbind§r on any other connection will copy the output frequency of the selected tunnel.%n

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1024.title=Inventory Sorting
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1024.desc=This pack has §bInventory Bogo Sorter§r, allowing for quick, customizable, and easy sorting of any inventory!%n%nThe default sort keybind is §aMiddle Click§r, §cbut you can always change the keybind. Simply hover over any slot in the inventory (§6Chests§r, §6Crates§r, your personal inventory, etc.), and click your sort keybind, and voila! A neat inventory.%n%nYou can also configure how it is sorted, within the GUI. The default key to open the GUI is §aK§r.%n%nInventory Bogo Sorter, by default, also replaces stacks of items, like blocks, tools and food in your hotbar. For tools, it even replaces it just before it breaks, so you can repair it! Now, you can build a pillar to y-256 without opening your inventory, or changing hotbar slots!

#db 1025 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1025.title=Powered Spawner
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1025.desc=The §6Powered Spawner§r is a machine from §bEnderIO§r.%n%nIt is used to automate the spawning and capture of mobs. As with all §bEnderIO§r machines, it requires a capacitor, with a higher tier capacitor increasing the range, spawning rate, and capture rate.%n%nIn order to set a §6Powered Spawner§r to the mob type that you want, you must combine it with a §6Broken Spawner§r, set to your specified mob type, in an anvil. %n%nThis §6Broken Spawner§r is set by putting a §6Broken Spawner§r, of any mob type, and a §6Soul Vial§r, of the specified mob, into a §aSoul Binder§r, with a few dashes of §aXP§r. Broken Spawners can be obtained by breaking a mob spawner. §eTIP: Spawners are all over the Lost Cities!§r%n%nThe spawner has two modes: Capture and Spawn.%n%nIn capture mode, you insert a §6Soul Vial§r into the machine, and the soul vial captures the §asoul§r of the set mob. This does not spawn any mobs, and thus works with any mob, even on peaceful.%n%nIn spawn mode, the spawner will spawn the mob that it is set to, until there is no space for them, or there are too many mobs in the area.%n%nNow you don't have to craft Soul Vials, but simply make them! It is also useful in certain crafts, such as the §aFlight Control Unit§r, in saving you a ton of XP.

#db 1027 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1027.title=Mastering Patterns
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1027.desc=Handling §6Patterns§r gets tedious pretty quickly, from not having enough slots to move tens of them at a time, to having to multiply them when upgrading your §3Large Machines§r, which, when equipped with §3Parallel Control Hatches§r, may require you to supply more than one item at a time to utilize them to their fullest.%n%nYou don't want to supply one ingot and get two wires when your §3Large Wire Factory§r can take §e64 ingots§r and make §e128 wires§r at a time, right?%n%nThat's where the the §6Pattern Multi-Tool§r comes into play. Granted, multiplying patterns early on is not something that you need right away, but there's more to this little thing.%n%nThe base functionalidy it provides is its UI, which makes it possible to §emove, multiply, divide and clear patterns in bulk§r. When an §3ME Interface§r is right-clicked, the multi-tool directly interfaces with it as well.%n%nMuch like the §eNetwork Tool§r, the multi-tool is capable of adding its own UI to all relevant §3Terminals§r where patterns can be utilized, most notably §3ME Interface Terminals§r, allowing you to adjust your patterns on the fly.%n%nAs a bonus, it can also hold §6Blank Patterns§r, injecting them into your §3Pattern Terminals§r may you ever run out of them. Fill this thing with blanks!

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1028.desc=Did you know that you now have the ability to build §3multi-block machines§r automatically? If you weren't aware, you're in for a surprise!%n%nTo get started, navigate to your §6Terminal§r, select §eApp Store§r, and scroll down until you locate §eMultiblock Helper§r. Inside, you'll discover an upgrade point titled §e"3D Builder"§r that's waiting for your attention. You can activate this upgrade by submitting §6two Workstations§r and §6four HV Emitters§r.%n%nOnce activated, sneak-right click on any multi-block controller with the Terminal in your hand to establish a connection. From the main screen, enter the Multiblock Helper app and you'll find that the 3D Builder §ehas now been unlocked§r.%n%nA couple of features to highlight are the §e"Debug" button§r and the §e"Build block" button§r. The Debug feature allows you to verify the structural integrity of your build and provides a visual feedback if any adjustments are needed. On the other hand, the "Build block" button allows you to build specific blocks in the UI. Simply select the corresponding block from your inventory to place, then click the button.%n%nAfter familiarizing yourself with these features, click on §e"Automatic Build"§r and watch as your Terminal takes blocks from your inventory and places them in the correct spots.%n%nBe aware, however, that §ethe placements might not always match your expectations§r, especially when using §3Buses§r and §3Hatches§r. As a precaution, you might want to avoid having these in your inventory during the build process.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.4.title=Iron Supply
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Nomifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. §2The upgraded HV Electric Prospector's Scanner you were given will tell you the types of ores you can find within a 7x7 chunk area!%n§r%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, there is a quest you can use to refill the energy of the scanner, which is located on this chapter.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired with §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron §cNuggets§e a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangeable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

You'll also find §6Malachite§f inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§f: Found essentially at ground level. §6Cassiterite§f is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is §2removed.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

#db 9 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.9.title=Ore Doubling?
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Nomifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials §fbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

You can make it semi-automatically by prestocking the components you need, and filling up the Extended Crafting Table with §bJEI§r!%n%nThis Micro Miner can get you:§6%n* Bauxite Ore%n§2* Pyrochlore Ore§6%n§c* Tantalite Ore§2%n* Copper Ore%n* Sphalerite Ore%n* Cassiterite Ore%n* Scheelite Ore%n* Tungstate Ore%n* Radium Salt§r%n%nAs well as the §6Stellar Creation Data§r, which will be useful much, much later.

#db 11 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.11.title=§2Electronics Subcomponents
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%n§2CEu circuit progression means you also have to put wires on your substrates for them to be usable. In this case, use some Copper Wires.§r%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Crafting Station§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

#db 12 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a §6Iron Tool §rof the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool's material in the recipes: it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress. %n%nThis quest technically accepts any tool material, but it is highly recommended to use §6Wrought Iron§r.

#db 13 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.13.title=Batch Crafting In Style
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item only when you need it, you'll go insane. It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§f frequently used items so you don't have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§f all at once.%n%n§3Crafting Stations§f are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.%n%nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.%n%nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.%n%nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.%n%nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.350.desc=The full complexity of §bNuclearCraft§r is far too much for the scope of this quest guide, so §eyou're encouraged to watch a tutorial or read a guide online§r. %n%nFor the purposes of this particular quest, you'll be building a breeder reactor to make §6Plutonium§r, and other nuclear elements. While this reactor may seem very expensive, it will be worth it, and you will probably expand it soon. %n%nThis reactor is capable of running any Low-Enriched fuel, such as TBU and LEU-235. This is a basic reactor and can be expanded, following the same pattern, to run faster. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 150 §6Fission Reactor Casings§r to encase a 5x5x5 cube shape of empty air. Any of these reactor casings can be changed to §6Transparent Fission Reactor Casings§r. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 5x5x5 space.%n%nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in an alternating pattern, with the reactor cells at the corners, and spaces between each one. Alternate between each row, creating a grid pattern. Fill in the §6Cryotheum Coolers§r between, in the empty holes. Do this for every layer, alternating between §6Cryotheum Coolers§r on the corners and §6Reactor Cells§r on the corners. You should have the perfect amount of §6Reactor Cells§r and §6Cryotheum Coolers§r for this, and the third and final layers should be the same as the first one. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.%n%nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.%n%nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.727.desc=When you first started the pack, we told you that ore doubling can wait, and that's true... But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.%n%nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no "Gallium Ore" or "Arsenic Ore". You get §6Gallium§r and §6Arsenic §ras a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §b§b§6Ore Byproduct Page§6§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing 'U' on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. %n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Ore Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. §2You can also perform a simple wash with this similar to Cauldron washing, which is extremely fast, but grants no byproducts.§r%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: §2uses Sodium Persulfate or Mercury to purify certain ores, granting a chance to yield a full pile of a byproduct.%n%n§r- §3§3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed §21 (nerfed from 3) tiny pile of byproduct§r.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process. §2Be warned that certain dusts may be better to directly smelt instead of electrolyze!§r%n%n- §3Thermal Centrifuge§r: not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge. §2Less slow and power-hungry now, but still so. However, it yields 3 additional tiny piles of byproduct, and macerating the Centrifuged Ore can grant a special third byproduct.%n%n§2- Sifter: filters high-quality Gems from Purified Crushed gem Ores for an overall higher yield.%n%n- Electromagnetic Separator: filters magnetic metals from certain ores, increasing their yields.§r%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

#db 730 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.730.title=Fluids and Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.730.desc=Working with fluids is a bit tricky. AE2 §aPatterns§r have no notion of fluids, meaning that you have to §ededicate separate machines to specific fluid combinations§r, ensuring they remain stocked.%n%nAE2 has a §aFluid Import Bus§r and §aFluid Export Bus§r, and this is the usual go-to for players experienced with AE2. A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump§r or a §aFluid Regulator§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and §aFluid Filters§r can allow routing specific fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For machines from other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

#db 731 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.731.title=Fluid Logistics
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.803.desc=Whether or not you (or your server admin) picked the default §bLost Cities§r overworld type, you have the option of teleporting yourself to the §eLost Cities Dimension§r. This is useful if you like other world types but want to still be able to explore cities for things like §eloot and spawners§r§r.%n%nTo create a portal, you must place a §aBed§r§r down on two §6Blocks of Diamond§r. Then, you surround the bed with any kind of §eMonster Skulls§r. Sleep in this bed and you will be teleported there.%n%n§cDon't forget to have a way to get back!§r§r You can use the §e/sethome§r§r command to register where your house is, and §e/home§r§r to return to it. If you supply a name (default "home") then you can register and go to multiple locations.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.804.title=Assembly Line Automation
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.804.desc=The §3Assembly Line§r is a particularly unusual multiblock from an automation standpoint. Up until now, it has been possible to dump ingredients into a single input bus. Clearly, this won't work for the Assembly line, since it has a whole bunch of ULV inputs buses that hold one item stack each.%n%nYou might be tempted to dump everything into a chest and route items around to specific buses with §aItem Conduits§r. You'll probably find this to be slow, prone to jamming, and inflexible when you want to run different recipes.%n%nIf you've unlocked §3The Empowerer§r, you might have considered §aPhantomfaces§r. These would certainly be an improvement over item conduits, but there's an even better solution.%n%nEnter §aItem Laser Relays§r§r: these handy tools from §bActually Additions§r allow you to create a virtual inventory out of multiple real ones; that is, you can use them to make other automation think that all of the input buses are the same inventory.%n%n§eOne important thing to note is that lasers appear to be "placed" on a particular block but they will interact with all adjacent (non-laser) blocks.§r Take this into account when placing them.%n%nTo start, place a laser on each of the input buses. Then, place the §aItem Interface§r adjacent to the laser on the first input bus. This will serve as the access point to the virtual inventory where you can connect things like an § §aME Interface§r.%n%nIf you don't have enough space in a normal pattern, try using the §6Extended Processing Pattern Terminal§r!%n%nTake your §aLaser Wrench§r and right click the first laser relay, then the second laser relay, to link them together. Repeat this with the second and third relays, third and fourth relays, etc. until they have all been linked together. Now you have a laser network virtualizing all of the input buses!%n%n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network's Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r%n%nRemember to always use §eBlocking Mode§r when connecting the laser network to on-demand crafting. If you don't use Blocking Mode, you are likely to accidentally craft something else and jam your Assembly Line.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.809.title=Setting Up Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.809.desc=This quest teaches you the basics about §bApplied Energistics 2§r autocrafting. If you are new this mod, it is highly recommended that you watch a video or read a guide online. Just remember that channels are disabled by default in this pack.%n%nBy now, you should have §6ME Interfaces, §6Molecular Assemblers, Crafting Units, Patterns§r and a §6Pattern Terminal§r. %n%nFirst, for all crafts, you'll need a §eCrafting CPU§r. These are structures that must be in a rectangular prism, and can be only one block. These compose of:%n* §6Crafting Storages§r, which determine how big a craft can be. For now, §64K Crafting Storages§r should be enough. You must have at least one per CPU.%n* §6Co-Processing Units§r, which are used to craft multiple things at once. These are optional.%n* §6Crafting Monitors§r, used to see what is crafting. Not needed, and you can right-click on the CPU to find out what is crafting anyways, so this is pretty much just decoration.%n* §6Crafting Units§r, which aren't needed at all, and are just used to fill holes, if you have a lack of materials.%n%nSecond, you'll need the place for the autocrafting. For Crafting Table recipes, you'll need §6Molecular Assemblers§r. §6Interfaces§r are placed next to them. Autocrafting with §bGregTech§r is explained later, in the quest following this one.%n%nFinally, you'll need a §6Pattern§r. In order to make this, put empty §6Patterns§r in the §6Pattern Terminal§r, and find the recipe in §bJEI§r, while still in the §6Pattern Terminal§r. Then, click '+' in §bJEI§r, and press the arrow to encode the recipe. This goes in the §6Interface§r that you set up in the last step. You can use §6Interface Terminals§r to access §6Interfaces'§r pattern slots.%n%nEventually, you'll need a lot of §6Patterns§r, lots of CPUs, and ones with more storage, and lots of §6§6§6Interfaces§r§r§r. If you run out of pattern slots in an §6Interface§r, you can add more §6Interfaces§r, or use newly added §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r, which add 9 slots each. You can have a maximum of 3 §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r in an §6Interface§r, which makes the amount of pattern slots go to 36.
