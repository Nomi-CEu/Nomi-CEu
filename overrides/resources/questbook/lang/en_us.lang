nomifactory.quest.db.4.title=Iron Supply
nomifactory.quest.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Nomifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. The §aScanner§f in your inventory can detect any ore within 16 blocks of you, so digging down and scanning should show you any nearby veins. Try scanning now by holding §6right-click§f until the progress meter completes.%n%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, the quest book will later guide you towards making a §aFlux Capacitor§f to charge tools in your inventory.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired with §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangeable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

nomifactory.quest.db.5.title=Mining Hammers
nomifactory.quest.db.5.desc=§aMining Hammers§r offer a relatively cheap way to mine out areas much faster. They clear a 3x3 of blocks and mine quickly, so they're absolutely worth investing your first few ingots of metal into§..%n%n§6Stone§f is the cheapest Mining Hammer, but naturally it breaks quickly. Since you have some §6Iron§f already, consider using those on your first few mining expeditions.%n%nThe best Mining Hammers are §6Diamond§f and §6Platinum§f. Other Mining Hammers are also good but wear out more quickly.

You'll also find §6Malachite§f inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§f: Found essentially at ground level, and almost always detectable by §aScanner§f from the surface. §6Cassiterite§f is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is just a less pure and less effective form of Coal.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

# db 9
nomifactory.quest.db.9.title=Ore Doubling?
nomifactory.quest.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Nomifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials or anything you buy with §dOmnicoins §fbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

# db 11
nomifactory.quest.db.11.title=Electronics Subcomponents
nomifactory.quest.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Crafting Station§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

# db 12
nomifactory.quest.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
nomifactory.quest.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a "§6Darmstadtium§f" tool (or sometimes §6Aluminium§f) of the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool's material in the recipes: it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress.

nomifactory.quest.db.13.title=Batch Crafting In Style
nomifactory.quest.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item only when you need it, you'll go insane. It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§f frequently used items so you don't have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§f all at once.%n%n§3Crafting Stations§f are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.%n%nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.%n%nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.%n%nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.%n%nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.

nomifactory.quest.db.53.desc=The §3Wiremill§r is a major efficiency boost, giving you a much greater yield of §6wires§r for your ingots. But first, you'll need to make some §6Motors§r.%n%n§bGregTech§r machines are built from a number of components, many of which are shared between the machines. Motors§r are used in a great number of recipes, even including other components.%n%nMake sure to encode the recipes needed for motors into a §3Crafting Station§r. You'll need quite a lot of them.%n%nAfter you make the Wiremill, §econsider making a few stacks§r of LV motors. This might sound extreme, but §ebatch crafting§r in this manner is an important habit to pick up. This way you won't have to craft more for a while, and you §owill §ruse all those motors eventually, so you're not wasting materials.%n%nAs you get access to more machinery you will no longer need to craft things manually.

nomifactory.quest.db.55.desc=Note: this quest accepts an LV, MV or HV Centrifuge.%n%n§3Centrifuges§r provide you with 3 tiny piles of additional materials when processing ore dusts (§e9 tiny piles=1 dust§r). Sometimes it's the main dust, but often it's a different useful material that is otherwise unobtainable.%n%nInstead of washing §6impure dusts§r (made from macerating or hammering ores) in a cauldron, you can get more out of each dust by centrifuging it. The same is true of §6pure dusts§r, when you eventually make a §3Washer§r or §3Chemical Bath§r. Note however that pure and impure dusts will usually give different byproducts (always check in §bJEI§r).%n%nCentrifuges also have other uses like unmixing compound dusts and fluids, or getting §6Rubber Pulp§r, which can be chemically reacted with §6Sulfur§r to efficiently make §9liquid Rubber§r.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.56.title=Putting It All Together
nomifactory.quest.db.56.desc=Now that you have everything you need to power your machines, it's time to put it all together.%n%nYour Steam Dynamo needs burnable fuel (like §6Coal§r) and §9water§r. It will output RF power through the Excitation Coil (the red bit at the top). The orientation of the Steam Dynamo can be adjusted with a §aCrescent Hammer§r, if needed.%n%n§6Energy Conduits§r can be used to transfer that RF power, but the dynamo can also output RF directly into a CEF by making the Excitation Coil touch the CEF.%n%nThe CEF transforms RF power into EU, outputting the resulting EU through the side with a red dot. The orientation can be adjusted using a §aWrench§r. Attach your §6Conductive Iron Cables§r to the output side of the CEF.%n%nNow all you need are some §bGregTech§r machines to hook up to the cables!

nomifactory.quest.db.60.desc=The §3Electric Blast Furnace§r is a major, major milestone in your §bGregTech§r career. It has the power to smelt more advanced materials. The first of which, §6Aluminium§r, is going to be important in the immediate future.%n%nThere is a diagram of how to build the EBF in §bJEI§r. The second and third levels must be a 3x3 square shape of Coil Blocks (§6Cupronickel§r is the only type of coil block you have access to for now) with an empty center. You can also §6sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.%n%nHowever, the bottom and top layers are very flexible. The §6EBF Controller§r must be on the §ebottom layer§r of the structure, and on the §emiddle of an outer edge§r. Otherwise, you can put the hatches and buses wherever you want, filling in all gaps in each layer with §6Heatproof Machine Casings§r. It's worth noting that you must §euse at least 10 Heatproof Machine Casings in your layout or the structure will not form§r.%n%nThis quest calls for two energy hatches, a fluid input and output, and an item input and output, which is a total of six positions. Their specific order and placement don't matter, as long as you can access them. The seventh position is your EBF controller, leaving eleven gaps to be filled by Heatproof Machine Casings. If you did everything right, the structure will form: the colors on its hatches and casings will unify, and the controller will say "Idling."%n%nYou'll most likely want to locate your power quite near to the EBF. It is very power hungry, and if it cannot get enough energy, progress on the current item smelting will start to regress. Be careful to ensure the EBF has enough power, and keep a Soft Hammer nearby to pause it by tapping the controller if you run out of power.

By placing a §6Storage Cell§r inside it, you can access the contents as though you were looking through a chest. You can carry the disk to another location and place it down in a different ME Chest if you want, and the items will come with it.%n%n§cDon't put Storage Cells inside other portable mod inventories like a Satchel, (or vice-versa) as you risk corrupting the contents of the Satchel and the Storage Cell.§r There's technical reasons why this happens (NBT overflow), and it's not unique to these items, but that's not really worth going into.%n%n

If you are going to be storing many different kinds of items in your network, you will need to make an §6ME Drive§r and fill it with multiple Storage Cells.%n%nThe §64k ME Storage Cell§r is the next size up.

The §6Zinc§r and §6Sulfur§r you get from doing this will be quite useful as well. Sphalerite Ore§r spawns in §6Zinc§r veins. %n%nA §3Centrifuge§r instead of a Cauldron is slower and requires power, but it gets you more Gallium while separating the impure dust into Sphalerite.%n%nIf you're having trouble getting the quest to complete, check to see if you are holding §6small piles§r instead of §6tiny piles§r.

Cutting blocks into 9 plates is much faster than using a §3Compressor§r to make them one at a time, and some plates can't be made in a Compressor at all.%n%nThe blade will require you to make §6Cobalt Brass§r. §6Cobalt§r is a byproduct obtained (likely first as tiny piles) from processing any of various ores, §6Zinc§r you should have already from electrolyzing §6Sphalerite§r, and the other materials are just §6Copper§r and §6Aluminium§r. If you're having trouble, keep in mind that §bJEI§r has a tab for ore processing byproducts that you can get to by looking up recipes for the regular-sized dust.%n%nCutting Machines work with plain §9Water§r for all recipes. You can also use §9Distilled Water§r which speeds up the processing somewhat, or §9Lubricant§r that speeds it up greatly (and uses very little per operation). These might be a little tricky to make right now, but are very worthwhile upgrades in the future.%n%nYou might consider waiting until you have §6Electronic Processors§r before progressing too far down the path of MV machines, since these circuits are much easier to make than §6Primitive Processors§r.

When you're ready to move on to HV recipes in the EBF, you'll want to move up to HV Energy Input Hatches, and so on.%n%nHowever, remember to keep the MV area separate from your LV area. §eHooking up an LV machine to MV current will result in the machine being destroyed! Also LV cables will burn up if you put MV current through them§r. That's why it's probably best to keep the areas separate until you're comfortable and confident with voltages. Eventually you can use transformers to switch voltages within a single setup, but don't feel forced to try that until you've got a grasp on the basics.%n%nAll RF power is the same (it has no voltages), so you can use RF conduits to route power from wherever you're generating and storing it to §3CEFs§r for each voltage. You don't have to use this setup, but it's the most foolproof one for a beginner. And if you're an expert, well... you don't need my advice.%n%nFor your MV cables, you can use §6Copper§r to start with. §6Energetic Alloy cables§r are lossless though, so consider them if you're able to mass produce those ingots.

If you want to use the minimum number of fluid hatches, you'll need to craft an additional §a28 casings§r.%n%nEach §aEnergy Input Hatch§r increases the reactor's power buffer. §aAll 16 Energy Input Hatches§r are required to be able to process all Mark 1 recipes and give a power buffer of §e160M EU§r.%n%nIn addition to the recipe power drain, Fusion Reactors have a §eheat§r mechanic related to the recipe's §e"Eu to Start"§r. This amount of power is drained from the reactor's buffer before starting the recipe to heat up the reactor to the necessary temperature, and is independent of the recipe's EU/t cost. As such, this determines the minimum tier of reactor you need for a recipe.%n%nIf the reactor stops processing, it will §erapidly lose heat§r, even if you pause it with a soft hammer. On the other hand, if the reactor is already at the required temperature for a recipe, §eno additional power§r is required to heat up the reactor! This is true even if you switch between different recipes. This mechanic incentivizes continuous use of the reactor.%n%nIf you switch to a recipe that requires more heat, §eonly the difference§r in heat values is consumed as EU to reach the target heat (up to a maximum heat equal to the reactor's current buffer).%n%nFusion Reactors don't overclock, and they gate the next tier of materials, so you will eventually want to make more than one.

Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 54 §6Reactor Casings§r to encase a 3x3 cube shape of empty air.

Then the §6Lapis Coolers§r will go between them: 4 on the top layer and 4 on the bottom layer. At this point, the top and bottom layers should have eight blocks each with an empty middle, and the middle layer is fully empty. In the middle layer, place the 4 §6Graphite Blocks§r on the corners, and the 4 §6Glowstone Coolers§r on the sides (so they touch both Lapis Coolers).

These are all AE2 devices, so you'll need to connect them to an ME Network.%n%nNext, right-click the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r, and you should see a button saying "Processing": this button cycles through recipe types, including the various Extended Crafting tables. You'll have to choose the appropriate table for the recipe you want to encode.%n%n§6Holders§r must be encoded in pairs: one for the Packager, and one for the Unpackager. Select the appropriate table for the recipe, look up the recipe you want to encode, and press §6[+]§r in §bJEI§r to fill it in. Put two Holders in the top-left slot and press Save to encode the recipe to both of them. Finally, put each Holder into the respective machines.%n%nIf you've done everything correctly, you should see the item appear as craftable in a Terminal.%n%nWhile it might seem that the crafting process is slow, §ePackagedAuto is excellent at parallelizing§r. You can surround an Unpackager with Crafters and it will use all of them. It's also possible to add more Unpackagers with Crafters to keep up with the Packager, as long as the Holders are all the same.%n%n

Its main purpose in §5Nomifactory§r is to allow you to automate extended crafting recipes.%n%nApplied Energistics 2 stores recipes in §aPatterns§r, but they are limited to at most 9 stacks of items (a standard 3x3 crafting grid). PackagedAuto stores recipes in §aPackage Recipe Holders§r, which don't have this limitation. Additionally, each Holder can store up to §e20 different recipes§r. Holders must be encoded in the §3Package Recipe Encoder§r.%n%nIn the vast majority of situations you'll need two identically-encoded Holders, as the following machines work together.%n%nThe §3Packager§r is a machine that compresses ingredients for a specific recipe into a set of §6Recipe Packages§r. Each package in a set can hold up to 9 stacks of ingredient items. A simple recipe might consist of one package, but a complex recipe can have up to 9 packages in its set (for 81 total item stacks).%n%nThe §3Unpackager§r is a machine that extracts ingredient items from complete sets of Recipe Packages made in a Packager, ejecting the items into an adjacent inventory. It will only extract the items if §eall packages in a set are present§r.%n%nWhen both a Packager and Unpackager are connected to an ME Network and have the same recipe, the resulting item will appear as craftable in your §aTerminal§r.%n%nUp to 8 §3Packager Extensions§r can optionally be added to the Packager to speed up package creation.

You get §6Gallium§r as a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §b§b§6Ore Byproduct Page§6§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing 'U' on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. The tooltips on a byproduct will specify what processing method is needed to obtain it.%n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. This is an improved alternative to dropping dusts in a Cauldron.%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: similar to a washer, but uses chemicals to purify the crushed ores. Has a chance to give a full pile of byproducts, often different than what the Washer would give.%n%n- §3§3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process.%n%nThe §3Thermal Centrifuge§r, not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge, can be used for alternative ore processing but is §edreadfully slow and power-hungry§r. No LV form exists, and its primary use is for §bNuclearCraft§r fission fuels.%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

nomifactory.quest.db.728.title=Resonant Clathrate
nomifactory.quest.db.728.desc=§6Uraninite Ore§r is the first source of §6Pulsating Dust§r but is not a very good one in the long term. Instead you should make §6Resonant Clathrates§r, which are an infinitely-renewable and effective source of Pulsating Dust.%n%nResonant Clathrates are made by melting §6Ender Pearls§r with a §3Fluid Extractor§r into §9Resonant Ender§r, then mixing that with §6Nether Quartz§r in an MV or better §3Chemical Reactor§r. Smelting this clathrate gives Pulsating Dust.%n%nWith Resonant Clathrates now accessible, everything you need for crafting §6Pulsating Polymer Clay§r can be automated in a net-positive loop.§r Doing so is a boon to automation of §bDeep Mob Learning§r, which is §ea primary source of important materials for the rest of the pack§r.%n%nThe exact implementation is up to you. Make use of the various LV and MV machines you have, and look through §bJEI§r for the automatable infinite sources of each ingredient (like §aEnderman Models§r for pearls).%n%n

# db 729
nomifactory.quest.db.729.title=Fluid Interface
nomifactory.quest.db.729.desc=This is the fluid counterpart to the standard §aME Interface§r.%n%nFluids inserted into it are automatically digitized into the network, though it does have internal storage that can back up if you run out of space.%n%nYou can configure the interface to stock up to six different fluids (or for faster throughput later on, several tanks of the same fluid). You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

# db 730
nomifactory.quest.db.730.title=Fluids and Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.db.730.desc=Working with fluids is a bit tricky. AE2 §aPatterns§r have no notion of fluids, meaning that you have to §ededicate separate machines to specific fluid combinations§r, ensuring they remain stocked.%n%nAE2 has a §aFluid Import Bus§r and §aFluid Export Bus§r, and this is the usual go-to for players experienced with AE2. A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump§r or a §aFluid Regulator§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and §aFluid Filters§r can allow routing specific fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For machines from other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

# db 731
nomifactory.quest.db.731.title=Fluid Logistics
nomifactory.quest.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.784.title=ME Cables
nomifactory.quest.db.784.desc=These are the basic cables used by §3Applied Energistics§r to transport network connectivity. Due to the fact that channels are disabled, these cables will be your main method of transporting network connectivity, rather than the dense cables.%n%nThese cables do not share blockspace with conduits or cables for other mods, so they can be somewhat unweildy to build with, but they do accept §3Applied Energistics§r§6§r §6Facades§r, so they can be hidden very easily.%n%nLater you can make a variant of the cable that can share blockspace with §3Ender IO§r conduits.

nomifactory.quest.db.785.desc=§9Rubber§r has been sufficient for making cables so far, but you will soon discover that this basic type of rubber won't withstand more than §eHigh Voltage§r. Higher quality rubber is necessary to properly insulate your wires.%n%nThere are two better types of rubber, and you will eventually need to make both of them. §eThese can also be used for insulating lower voltage wires more efficiently, requiring less fluid§r!%n%n§9Styrene-Butadiene Rubber§r is capable of withstanding up to §eLuV§r. However, this requires petrochemistry infrastructure you may not have yet, and is not mandatory until you are making late-game components.%n%n§9Silicone Rubber§r is the highest quality of rubber and can be used §efor all voltages§r. It can also conveniently be made from chemicals you are already familiar with. By setting this up now, you won't have to change your wire coating material later!%n%nTo make Silicone Rubber, you will need to create §6Polydimethylsiloxane Dust§r in one of several ways, then mix it with §6Sulfur§r in a §3Chemical Reactor§r. You can then coat wires with it in an §3Assembling Machine§r.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.786.title=Effortless Building
nomifactory.quest.db.786.desc=§bEffortless Building§r is a mod that makes it much easier to build. You can create large platforms or various other shapes in just a few clicks, and even build multiple identical structures at the same time!%n%nTo use §bEffortless Building§r, start by pressing and holding the §6Alt§r key. This opens a wheel-shaped menu displaying §especial building modes§r. With this menu open, simply move your cursor over the desired building mode and release §6Alt§r. This will select that mode and you can begin building.%n%nChoose the starting location for your shape by §6right-clicking§r on a blockspace while holding your desired building block. Next, move your cursor to another blockspace to see a preview of the final structure. §6Right-click§r again on the desired ending block to actually build the shape from blocks in your inventory.%n%nMost shapes are flat and are defined using a starting and ending location, but 3D shapes have a third location to complete the shape. Some special modes also have §eoptions§r, like making a §ehollow cube§r instead of a §efilled cube§r.%n%nIf you made a mistake, you can use the §aUndo§r button in the menu to break the blocks you just placed so you can collect them and try again.%n%nTo change building modes, just open the menu with §6Alt§r as before and pick a different one. To exit the special building modes, select the §eNormal§r mode.%n%n§cMake sure you return to Normal mode when you're done building shapes, since the special building modes will interfere with normal gameplay.§r%n%nThe size of shapes you can make in special building modes is limited by your §ereach§r, which is how far away you can click from yourself to start building, or from the previous location to complete a shape. You can craft and eat several tiers of §areach upgrades§r in succession to increase your reach to very high numbers.%n%nOverall, §bEffortless Building§r is a powerful mod that is very useful for construction. Experiment with it and you'll see how much time it can save you!

nomifactory.quest.db.787.title=Farming Station
nomifactory.quest.db.787.desc=The §3Farming Station§r is a machine that automates growing and harvesting trees and crops around it, based on what items you put in it.%n%nThe Farming Station will principally collect crops, saplings, and wood, but it will also collect things like §6Apples§r from Oak Trees and §6Sticky Resin§r from Rubber Trees. It can also collect leaves if you want it to.%n%nLike other §bEnderIO§r machines, it requires an §6RF capacitor§r. The quality of capacitor affects the overall size of the farm as well as the speed and energy at which it operates.%n%nYou can configure which crops or tree types will be planted relative to the Farming Station by placing the crop or sapling in the various quadrants in the GUI. Clicking the lock button will ensure that the stack placed there won't be completely consumed, as that could lead to plants migrating to other quadrants.%n%nIn addition to power, the Farming Station§r requires specific §etools§r (and usually a supply of §9Water§r) to operate. If you're missing anything, the machine will refuse to operate and displays a message over itself to let you know.%n%nFor planting §6crops§r or §6saplings§r, you need a §aHoe§r.%nFor chopping §6trees§r, you need an §aAxe§r. To collect §6leaves§r, you also need §aShears§r.%n%nTool durability is consumed as the farm performs work, so the tools will eventually break. You can make §aStone Tools§r from a cobblestone generator and some sticks, or even §aDiamond Tools§r using diamonds from your §3Deep Mob Learning§r setup.%n%nAlternately, you can invest in fancier tools such as th§re §aDark Backhoe§r (which is designed for use in the Farming Station), or even unbreakable tools much later like the §aFlux Infused Axe§r and §aOmniwrench§r (shears).%n%nThe Farming Station also has a lesser-known feature: it respects enchantments and upgrades on your tools. Tools with §eEmpowered§r upgrades will be ejected into the output slots when they run out of charge (if they don't break first). Tools with the §eMending§r enchantment are similarly ejected when they are about to break.%n%nYou can use these properties to your advantage.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.788.title=Smart Item Filter
nomifactory.quest.db.788.desc=The §6Smart Item Filter§r from §3GregTech§r is an important tool when automating otherwise troublesome machines. It is a cover which filters item transfer based on whether a valid recipe exists for those items in a specified machine.%n%nThis is powerful in combination with movement covers like the §6Robot Arm§r. If you place this filter on the §eElectrolyzer§r mode in a Robot Arm set to §eSupply Exact§r mode, the Robot Arm will transfer precisely the right amounts of all valid items into an §3Electrolyzer§r so it will operate without clogging. There's no other way to accomplish this feat!%n%nThis filter also has §eSifter§r and §eCentrifuge§r§r modes for use with those machines (though §3Sifters§r are not in §5Nomifactory§r). It does not have modes for any other machines.%n%nThe §eDefault§r button lets you click it to §eIgnore Fluids§r, which is useful when you have recipes that also require fluids (like §9Hydrogen§r in an Electrolyzer). Since Robot Arms can't move fluids, it would otherwise prevent the cover from working.%n

# db 789
nomifactory.quest.db.789.title=Filters
nomifactory.quest.db.789.desc=§aFilters§r are a type of machine cover that controls what items or fluids are allowed to pass through it. They can be used directly on the side of a machine to affect external automation or the Machine's §aAuto-Output Functionality§r.%n%nYou can also §eplace filters inside of other covers§r to control what items or fluids that cover will interact with. When used in a §6Robot Arm§r, §aItem Filters§r make for a powerful automation tool for §ekeeping specific items in stock§r in specific quantities in Machines. With §6Fluid Regulators§r, similar behavior is possible with fluids using a §aFluid Filter§r. For §6Conveyors§r and §6Pumps§r, it simply limits what that cover will move.%n%n§aFilters§r all have 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes, and can be applied to multiple sides of machines. When placed inside a §6Robot Arm§r in §eKeep Exact§r or §eSupply Exact§r mode§r, the item count in a filter can be incremented by §eRight Clicking§r and decremented by §eLeft Clicking§r. Holding §eShift§r causes the count to increase/decrease by a factor of 2. This controls the number of each type of item that will be kept in stock or moved at a time.%n%nSimilar controls are available for the §aFluid Filter§r when placed inside a §6Fluid Regulator§r.%n%nAdditionally, the §aOre Dictionary Filter§r§r is a powerful tool that has a specialized filter which uses ore dictionary entries and supports "*" as a wildcard, e. g. "§6ingotHot*§r" will match all hot ingots, "§6dustRegular*§r" will match all regular dusts, and "§6dustTiny*§r" will match all tiny piles.%n%nAll §bGregTech§r Filters can be configured using ghost items from §bJEI§r.

# db 790
nomifactory.quest.db.790.title=Machine Controllers
nomifactory.quest.db.790.desc=The §6Machine Controller§r is a cover that manages the operation of §bGregTech§r machines, similar to a §aSoft Hammer§r. These are crucial for §epassive automation§r, where a machine is dedicated to keeping something in stock for you.%n%n"Machines" here is broader than you might think. It of course works on single-block machines, but can also be used on §eMultiblock Controllers§r like your §3Electronic Blast Furnace§r. But it's even more flexible than that: you can use it on any §bGregTech§r block that accepts transfer covers, as long as the controllable cover is placed on it first! This means it also works for things like §6Chests§r, §6Drums§r, and Multiblock inputs.%n%nThe cover works by detecting a §eredstone signal§r. By default, the entire machine will be disabled if a sufficiently strong signal is detected by the cover.%n%nWhen you open the Machine Controller's GUI with a §aScrewdriver§r, you will see several options for configuring its behavior:%n%nThe strength of the signal required to trigger the Machine Controller is configurable using the top slider.%n%nAnother button allows you to select whether to control the whole machine (where applicable) or a specific cover. This lets you do things like stop moving items into a machine, but also allow the machine to continue working.%n%nSwitching from §eNormal§r to §eInverted§r mode will make the Machine Controller instead disable the machine until it receives the requisite redstone signal. This is often preferable when working with §6Level Emitters§r to prevent machines from starting up if your §eME Network§r is offline.%n%nSome use cases:%n• Control machines through vanilla redstone contraptions or a simple lever.%n%n• The §6Redstone Upgrades§r from §bStorage Drawers§r can be used when outputting into a drawer to make the drawer emit redstone that can control the machine.%n%n• When you progress to digital storage, an §6ME Level Emitter§r or §6ME Fluid Level Emitter§r can be used to emit signal based on specific items or fluids in your network.%n

nomifactory.quest.db.791.title=Processing Array
nomifactory.quest.db.791.desc=The §6Processing Array§r is a §bGregTech§r multiblock that allows for processing multiple recipes in parallel in a single stucture and is extremely useful for saving space.%n%nUp to 16 of the same recipe can be processed in parallel by placing the machines for the recipe in exactly one §aMachine Access Interface§r in the multiblock structure, as well as the ingredients and non-consumable items (like §6Integrated Circuits§r) for the recipe you want to process in one or more input buses. While a recipe is running, the Machine Access Interface is §elocked§r and machines cannot be added or removed.%n%nNote that each machine will still draw the full voltage required for the recipe, which may be more than a single §aEnergy Input Hatch§r can provide. This is why the §6Processing Array§r has an astounding Hatch limit, and can support up to §e8 Energy Inputs§r on the structure. This allows you to get the needed 16 Amps of power to the machine from a single tier-appropriate §3CEF§r.%n%nProcessing Arrays distribute their buffered power at the appropriate voltage, so there's no danger of your machines exploding if you, for example, operate 16 HV machines off one amp of IV power.%n%nBecause the required number of Inputs, Outputs, and Casings is highly variable, this quest only asks you to craft the §6Processing Array Controller§r and the §aMachine Access Interface§r. Make sure your buses and hatches are large enough to hold the ingredients and outputs for the number of parallel crafts you're attempting, and that you're providing enough power for all those machines!%n%nAn advanced feature of the Processing Array is §eDistinct Bus Mode§r. This makes the Processing Array only consider a single item input bus at a time when determining whether it can run a recipe. This is useful when recipes for a particular machine require different catalyst items, like §6Integrated Circuits§r on different configurations or §6Extruder Shapes§r.%n%nDistinct Bus Mode may be enabled or disabled via the Processing Array controller by clicking in the designated area.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.804.desc=The §a§r§3Assembly Line§r is a particularly unusual multiblock from an automation standpoint. Up until now, it has been possible to dump ingredients into a single input bus. Clearly, this won't work for the Assembly line, since it has a whole bunch of ULV inputs buses that hold one item stack each.%n%nYou might be tempted to dump everything into a chest and route items around to specific buses with §aItem Conduits§r. You'll probably find this to be slow, prone to jamming, and inflexible when you want to run different recipes.%n%nIf you've unlocked §3§3The Empowerer§r§r, you might have considered §aPhantomfaces§r. These would certainly be an improvement over item conduits, but there's an even better solution.%n%nEnter §aItem Laser Relays§r§r: these handy tools from §bActually Additions§r allow you to create a virtual inventory out of multiple real ones; that is, you can use them to make other automation think that all of the input buses are the same inventory.%n%n§eOne important thing to note is that lasers appear to be "placed" on a particular block but they will interact with all adjacent (non-laser) blocks.§r Take this into account when placing them.%n%nTo start, place a laser on each of the input buses. Then, place the §a§aItem Interface§r adjacent to the laser on the first input bus. This will serve as the access point to the virtual inventory where you can connect things like an §3Unpackager§r or §aME Interface§r.%n%nTake your §aLaser Wrench§r and right click the first laser relay, then the second laser relay, to link them together. Repeat this with the second and third relays, third and fourth relays, etc. until they have all been linked together. Now you have a laser network virtualizing all of the input buses!%n%n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network's Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r%n%nIf you need to do recipes with an §6§6Integrated Circuit§r, you can leave it in an input bus and skip placing a laser there. Remember to always use §eBlocking Mode§r when connecting the laser network to on-demand crafting. As long as you do, you can have §edifferent circuits in the Assembly Line without recipe conflicts§r. If you don't use Blocking Mode, you are likely to accidentally craft something else and jam your Assembly Line.
