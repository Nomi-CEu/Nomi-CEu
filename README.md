## Server Setup and Information
Details on how to setup a basic server, and some important server admin information, are listed [here.](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu/blob/main/serverfiles/README.md)

## Addon Mods
Nomi-CEu comes with addon scripts for the following mods. You can drop them into the mods folder, and their recipes will be adjusted accordingly.  
- [AE2 Fluid Crafting Rework](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-fluid-crafting-rework)  
- [Compact Machines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compact-machines)  
- [Flux Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flux-networks)  
- [Lazy AE2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazy-ae2)  
- [Project Red - Illumination](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-red-illumination)    

\* Note: If you are adding these mods via the CurseForge app, remove the extra copy of AE2 **(*non*-extended life)**, of which it might automatically download.

## Expert Mode 
If you want a harder, or perhaps a more "true" GregTech experience, check out the Expert mode. This pack mode is based on the [Self-Torture Edition Fork](https://github.com/NotMyWing/Omnifactory-Self-Torture-Edition) of the original pack. 

### Highlights include:
- Forced Peaceful Mode
- No DME for easy infinite resources
- Nomicoins can't be spent, or obtained
- The Steam Age
- More Focus on GT Power Generation
- No Creative Tank; instead...
    - Stabilized Micro Miners for late-game infinite resources  
- Harder recipes for assorted things like Iridium, Graphene, Numismatic Dynamos, and more
