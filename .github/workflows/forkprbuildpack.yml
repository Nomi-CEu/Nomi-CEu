# This workflow file tests PRs made from forks. Disable this if it is considered too much of a security risk (although many efforts have been taken to reduce risk)
# If workflow enabled, make sure to set the environment used to need a specific team (admin-devs), and default GITHUB_TOKEN perms to read!
